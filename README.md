# BarkBuddy Site 🐾

A playful single-page marketing site for a fictional dog hangout app. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to showcase services, testimonials, and contact options for dog lovers.

## Features
- **Responsive layout** that adapts to phones, tablets, and desktops.
- **Hero, features, and CTA sections** encouraging visitors to join BarkBuddy.
- **Download badges** for App Store / Google Play (SVG assets included).
- **Contact form UI** handled by `contact.js`.
- **Reusable icons and illustrations** stored under `images/` plus custom SVGs.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – main markup for all sections.
- `css/` – stylesheets controlling layout, typography, and animations.
- `contact.js` – form validation or submission logic (if any).
- `images/` & standalone `.svg` files – branding assets, icons, and CTA buttons.
- `.gitignore` – ignores editor and build artifacts.

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/BarkBuddy-Site.git
cd BarkBuddy-Site
```
Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve it locally:
```bash
npx serve .
```

## Customization Ideas
- Swap copy/images to match your own pet service or startup.
- Hook the contact form to a backend or service like Netlify Forms.
- Add smooth scrolling, section reveal animations, or dark mode.

## Contributing
Issues and pull requests are welcome—feel free to enhance responsiveness, accessibility, or add new sections (FAQs, pricing, blog).
